# Robotics_with_UR3_and_Gazebo
This repository contains code from Introduction to Robotics with Prof.'s Katie Driggs-Campbell and Dan Block at UIUC. Course content available at https://publish.illinois.edu/ece470-intro-robotics/ but the lab manual changes often so there aren't accurate instructions on these labs online.  

Please do not steal the code if you are currently in the course, there is no guarentee that any of it is correct or up to date as I took the course in 2020 and the content of the labs is extemely prone to change from semester to semester. I am currently uploading my completed code and redoing some of the files that I feel could be touched up to refresh my memory and build a github I feel proud sharing with recruiters.

## Content
Each lab will have its own README file explaining what was done by me and information on how to run it on your own machine or a demo of its output if possible.  
  
[Tower_of_Hanoi](https://github.com/monk200/Robotics_with_UR3_and_Gazebo/tree/main/Tower_of_Hanoi): A lab meant to get comfortable using the ROS package in Python to control the UR3
[Camera_Sensing_and_Particle_Filter](https://github.com/monk200/Robotics_with_UR3_and_Gazebo/tree/main/Camera_Sensing_and_Particle_FIlter): A lab that works with ROS and OpenCV in Python to detect an orange dot attached to the UR3 and uses a particle filter to estimate the location of the UR3's end effector.  
[Kinematics](https://github.com/monk200/Robotics_with_UR3_and_Gazebo/tree/main/Kinematics): Python files that perform forward and inverse kinematics on the UR3 (including a symbolic partial solution for forward kinematics).

## Setup
TBA
